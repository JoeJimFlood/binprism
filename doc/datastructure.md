# Data Structure
BinPrism uses nested classes. The most basic class is the [FourierSeries](https://github.com/JoeJimFlood/binprism/blob/master/doc/FourierSeries.md). This object contains a NumPy array of the zero and positive-indexed components of a Fourier series (the negative-indexed components are derived using complex conjugation). The next class up is the [PPD](https://github.com/JoeJimFlood/binprism/blob/master/doc/PPD.md) (periodic probability distribution), which is defined by the Fourier coefficients of its log-pdf, expressed as a `FourierSeries` instance. `PPD` objects also have a [MomentCalculator](https://github.com/JoeJimFlood/binprism/blob/master/doc/MomentCalculator.md), which is used to calculate circular moments of the distribution. The final, primary class in BinPrism is that of the [Profile](https://github.com/JoeJimFlood/binprism/blob/master/doc/Profile.md), which is a `PPD` along with a total number of events and a range of times over which the events take place. The `fit` method creates a `Profile` from input binned data using the algorithm described [here](https://github.com/JoeJimFlood/binprism/blob/master/doc/methodology.md).
