To install BinPrism, perform the following steps: <br />

1. Do one of the following: <br />
  a) Clone the repository by typing the following command into a Git shell:
  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/JoeJimFlood/binprism
  ```
  b) Download the repository as a zip file, and extract it somewhere. <br />
<br />
2. Navigate to the directory where the repository was cloned or extracted to, and run the script install_binprism.py. A window will open up asking for the Python directory to install to, unless it is specified when the script is run from the command line:
```
>python install_binprism.py [Python directory]
```
