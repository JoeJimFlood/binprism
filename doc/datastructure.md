# Data Structure
BinPrism uses nested classes. The most basic class is the FourierSeries. This object contains a NumPy array of the zero and positive-indexed components of a Fourier series (the negative-indexed components are derived using complex conjugation). The next class up is the PPD (periodic probability distribution), which is defined by the Fourier coefficients of its log-pdf, expressed as a `FourierSeries` instance. The final, primary class in BinPrism is that of the Profile, which is a `PPD` along with a total number of events and a range of times over which the events take place. In addition, a MomentCalculator class exists for calculating circular moments of `PPD` instances.
